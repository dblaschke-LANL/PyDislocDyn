'''This submodule defines the StrohGeometry class to calculate the displacement field of a steady state dislocation
   aand other properties, as well as the Dislocation class which inherits from StrohGeometry
   and metal_props of polycrystal_averaging.py. As such, it is the most complete class to compute properties
   dislocations, both steady state and accelerating. Additionally, the Dislocation class can calculate
   additional properties like limiting velocities of dislocations. We also define a function, readinputfile,
   which reads a PyDislocDyn input file and returns an instance of the Dislocation class.'''
